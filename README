In the top level folder, run
make
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/build:$PYTHONPATH
to be able to use an LSBF from Python3.

Note you will need the following dependencies:
python3
pybind11, installed with pip
c++ compiler

Also note I have only tested this on Ubuntu.

TODO: Add this all to a setup.py folder (use CMake?)
